The package has been developed from a private monorepo so far, this is a first step to make it public with a proper development and release process.

To evaluate things around strict CSPs you need to serve a production build:

```
yarn start
```

or deploy the e2e test app (uses a package build from source) to Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnibtime%2next-safe-middleware%2Ftree%2Fmain)

In your Vercel project settings:

Set `apps/e2e` as "Root Directory" and enable "Include source files outside of the Root Directory in the Build Step."

In "Build & Development Settings"
override the following commands:

**Build Command:** 
```
cd ../.. && yarn vercel-build-e2e
```
**Install Command:** 
```
yarn install --immutable
```
