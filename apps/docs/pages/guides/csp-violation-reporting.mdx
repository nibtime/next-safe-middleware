# CSP violation reporting

## Set up reporting endpoint

add the `reporting` middleware to your middleware chain in `middleware.js`:

```js
// middleware.js
import {
  chainMatch,
  isPageRequest
  csp,
  reporting,
  strictDynamic,
  strictInlineStyles,
} from '@next-safe/middleware';

const securityMiddleware = [
  csp(),
  strictDynamic(),
  reporting(),
];

export default chainMatch(isPageRequest)(...securityMiddleware);
```

then, set up the reporting endpoint in `pages/api/reporting.js`:

```js
// pages/api/reporting.js
import { reporting } from "@next-safe/middleware/dist/api";

/** @type {import('@next-safe/middleware/dist/api').Reporter} */
const consoleLogReporter = (data) =>
  console.log(JSON.stringify(data, undefined, 2));

export default reporting(consoleLogReporter);
```

CSP violation reports will be send to this endpoint, both from `report-uri` and `report-to` directives. The data shape of reports is slightly different between both directives. The API handler parses the data into a discriminated union and passes it to all reporter functions. You can pattern-match the data there with IntelliSense support.

## Send violation reports to Sentry

If you use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for monitoring your app, there is a convenient helper `sentryCspReporterForEndpoint` to create a reporter, that ingests all CSP violations into your Sentry project:

```jsx
// pages/api/reporting.js
import {
  reporting,
  sentryCspReporterForEndpoint,
} from "@next-safe/middleware/dist/api";

// lookup at https://docs.sentry.io/product/security-policy-reporting/
const sentryCspEndpoint = process.env.SENTRY_CSP_ENDPOINT;
const sentryCspReporter = sentryCspReporterForEndpoint(sentryCspEndpoint);

export default reporting(sentryCspReporter);
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Sentry only supports the data format of the `report-uri` directive. It can't
  receive violation reports in `report-to` format. However, all Chromium-based
  browsers send violation reports in `report-to` format.
  `sentryCspReporterForEndpoint` does the necessary conversion, so you will
  receive reports from all major browsers in Sentry.
