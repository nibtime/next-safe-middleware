# Compose middleware

In your `middleware.js` you might potentially want to do more interesting things than just setting security headers. However, Next.js doesn't offer an idiomatic abstraction for composing middlewares yet.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  If you like to use this package for composing middleware only, there's a
  bundle `@next-safe/middleware/dist/compose` for just that.
</Callout>

## `chain`

This package provides a minimal and simple abstraction for composing/chaining multiple middlewares within the `middleware.js` file. For this, it provides a function **`chain`**, that accepts an array of type `ChainableMiddleware`.

The `ChainableMiddleware` interface is compatible with the Next.js spec (what needs to be exported from `middleware.js`) and provides additional handles for composition of multiple middlewares with **`chain`**:

```ts
type NextMiddlewareResult = NextResponse | Response | null | undefined;

// this is the Middleware spec of Next.js
type NextMiddleware = (
  request: NextRequest,
  event: NextFetchEvent
) => NextMiddlewareResult | Promise<NextMiddlewareResult>;

// this is the extended spec this package uses
type ChainableMiddleware = (
  request: NextRequest,
  event: NextFetchEvent
  ctx?: MiddlewareChainContext
) => NextMiddlewareResult | void | Promise<NextMiddlewareResult | void>;
```

**`request`**: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions#nextrequest

**`event`**: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions#nextfetchevent

**`ctx`** : a context object of type `MiddlewareChainContext`:

```ts
type MiddlewareChainContext<K, V> = {
  res: {
    readonly get: () => NextMiddlewareResult;
    readonly set: (res: NextMiddlewareResult, override?: boolean) => void;
  };
  cache: {
    readonly get: (key: K) => V | null | undefined;
    readonly set: (key: K, value: V) => void;
  };
  finalize: {
    readonly addCallback: (finalizer: ChainFinalizer<K, V>) => void;
    readonly removeCallback: (finalizer: ChainFinalizer<K, V>) => void;
    readonly terminatedByResponse: () => boolean;
  };
};
```

**`res`**: accessors for a continued response. `ChainableMiddleware`'s' can access and modify it (adding/changing headers, cookies etc.) or set it for middlewares to their right to pick up upon.

**`cache`**: accessors for an object cache for the lifetime of `chain`.

**`finalize`**: handles for `ChainableMiddleware`'s to (un)register callbacks to be executed before `chain`terminates.

When executed in `chain`, the return value of `ChainableMiddleware` is interpreted as follows:

- a `ChainableMiddleware` returns a response: `chain` gets terminated. Middlewares to its right in the chain don't execute
- a `ChainableMiddleware` returns nothing: `chain` continues with the middleware to its right
- a `ChainableMiddleware` passes a response with `ctx.res.set` and returns nothing: `chain` continues with the middleware to its right, which can retrieve this response with `ctx.res.get`.

### Only match a subset of requests with `chainMatch`

To execute a middleware chain only on a subset of requests, there's a variant `chainMatch`.

It consumes a matcher function of type `NextRequestPredicate` as its argument and returns a matched variant of `chain`:

```ts
type NextRequestPredicate = (req: NextRequest) => boolean;
type ChainMatcher = NextRequestPredicate;
```

The resulting middleware chain will only execute if the matcher function evaluates to `true` for a request. Other than that, it behaves like regular `chain`.

```ts
const isPageRequest: NextRequestPredicate = (req) => ...

const chainableMiddlewares: ChainableMiddleware[] = [...]

const chainOnPageRequests = chainMatch(isPageRequest)

const middleware = chainOnPageRequests(...chainableMiddlewares)
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Stable root-level middleware of [Next.js
  12.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2) matches all requests by default,
  including assets in `public` and files under `/_next`. Read the [middleware
  upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-upgrade-guide)
  before you upgrade an existing setup with Beta middleware.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The abstractions around `chain` are work in progress and an experiment to see
  what works well for composition and they are necessary to ship CSP and
  security middleware as modular and reusable pieces. As soon as something
  simliar becomes part of Next.js, this package will use them and deprecate the
  custom ones.
</Callout>

### Example: Security middleware with Geo-blocking

```js
// middleware.js
import {
  chain,
  chainMatch,
  isPageRequest,
  csp,
  strictDynamic,
} from "@next-safe/middleware";

/** @type {import('@next-safe/middleware').ChainableMiddleware} */
const geoBlockMiddleware = (req) => {
  const BLOCKED_COUNTRY = "GB";
  const country = req.geo.country || "US";

  if (country === BLOCKED_COUNTRY) {
    const response = new Response("Blocked for legal reasons", { status: 451 });
    // returning response terminates the chain
    return response;
  }
};

const securityMiddleware = [csp(), strictDynamic()];

/**
 * geoBlockMiddleware will be invoked on all requests
 * from `BLOCKED_COUNTRY` and then block the request
 * and terminate chain by returning a response with status 451
 *
 * securityMiddleware will only run on requests
 * that didn't get geo-blocked and only on requests for pages
 */
export default chain(
  geoBlockMiddleware,
  chainMatch(isPageRequest)(...securityMiddleware)
);
```

## Configurable middleware

### Usage

Every middleware of this package supports configuration with an (async) initializer function:

```ts
type ConfigInitializerParams = {
  req: NextRequest;
  evt: NextFetchEvent;
  ctx: MiddlewareChainContext;
  // from next/server
  userAgent: UserAgent;
};

type ConfigInitalizer<Config> = (
  params: ConfigInitializerParams
) => Config | Promise<Config>;

type MiddlewareConfig<Config> = Config | ConfigInitalizer<Config>;
```

For example, you can use this capability to select different CSP configurations for different user agents:

```js
// middleware.js
import {
  chainMatch,
  isPageRequest,
  csp,
  strictDynamic,
} from "@next-safe/middleware";

// CSP in always in report-only mode for Firefox
// and by env var for other browsers
const cspMiddleware = csp(async ({ userAgent }) => {
  const browserName = userAgent.browser.name || "";
  const reportOnly =
    !!process.env.CSP_REPORT_ONLY || browserName.includes("Firefox");
  return {
    reportOnly,
  };
});

const securityMiddleware = [cspMiddleware, strictDynamic()];

export default chainMatch(isPageRequest)(...securityMiddleware);
```
